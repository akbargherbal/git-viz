# Git Repository Visualization

A specialized visualization tool designed to analyze the lifecycle, social structure, and temporal evolution of Git repositories. This project renders complex Git history data into interactive dashboards, running entirely client-side using pre-processed JSON datasets.

## 🔭 Project Overview

This application serves as an interactive explorer for Git repository data. It allows developers and analysts to understand how a codebase has evolved over time, identifying hotspots of activity, author collaboration patterns, and structural changes.

The project is built on a **Plugin Architecture**, allowing different visualization modules to be registered and rendered dynamically.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Timeline Heatmap (Primary Visualization)

A highly interactive, temporal grid that visualizes activity across the directory structure.

- **Temporal Navigation:** Group activity by Day, Week, Month, Quarter, or Year.
- **Metric Switching:** Visualize by Commits, File Events, or Active Authors.
- **Deep Inspection:** Click any cell to open a Detail Panel showing specific file operations, top contributors, and event composition (Adds/Mods/Deletes).
- **Advanced Filtering:** Slice data by Author, File Type, or specific sub-directories.

### 2. Treemap Structure

A hierarchical view of the repository's file structure.

- _Current Status:_ Provides a static overview of the directory layout and file distribution.
- _Future Goal:_ To become an interactive drill-down explorer for file-level metrics.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **Frontend Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript and Vite.
- **State Management:** Zustand for global state and filter propagation.
- **Visualization Engine:**
  - Custom DOM-based rendering for the high-performance Heatmap grid.
  - D3.js for hierarchical calculations and Treemap rendering.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a responsive, dark-mode UI.

### Data Strategy (Zero-Backend)

The application runs without a dedicated API server. Instead, it consumes static JSON datasets generated by an external analysis pipeline.

It loads and aggregates specific datasets on the fly:

- `file_lifecycle.json`: The raw event stream of file operations.
- `directory_stats.json`: Pre-aggregated activity scores.
- `author_network.json`: Collaboration data.
- `file_index.json`: Metadata and statistics for individual files.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open the application:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## 🆕 Recent Development (Phase 1 - V2.X Refactor)

### Data Infrastructure Foundation (January 2026)

The project has undergone a significant infrastructure upgrade to support a more extensible plugin architecture:

**New Data Services** (`/src/services/data/`)

- **DatasetRegistry**: Central catalog of all V2 datasets with metadata, type classification, and validation utilities
- **PluginDataLoader**: Cache-aware data loading system with support for declarative plugin requirements, transforms, and preloading

**Key Improvements:**
- All 12 V2 datasets now cataloged and accessible through a unified registry
- Declarative data loading pattern for future plugins
- Intelligent caching reduces redundant network requests
- Support for required vs optional datasets with proper error handling
- Dataset transforms allow plugins to receive pre-processed data

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Existing Timeline Heatmap continues to work with current data loading
- New infrastructure is opt-in for future plugins
- Zero regression risk

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: Enhance plugin types to use declarative data requirements
- Phase 3: Refactor Timeline Heatmap to use new data infrastructure
- Phase 4: Activate Treemap visualization with proper data wiring

For detailed information, see `/src/services/data/README.md`

## 📊 Available Datasets

The application now has 12 V2 datasets available through the DatasetRegistry:

**Time Series:** temporal_daily, temporal_weekly, temporal_monthly, temporal_quarterly, temporal_yearly  
**Core Data:** file_lifecycle, file_index  
**Hierarchy:** directory_stats  
**Networks:** author_network, cochange_network  
**Snapshots:** release_snapshots

## 🧪 Development

### Running Examples

```typescript
// Test the new data infrastructure
import { runAllExamples } from '@/services/data/example';
runAllExamples();
```

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run type-check
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
