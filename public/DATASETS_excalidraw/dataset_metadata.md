## 📖 Usage Notes

### Temporal Analysis
Use the `temporal` object to:
- Group commits by week, month, quarter, or year
- Analyze activity patterns by day of week
- Track development velocity over time

### Author Analysis
Use `author_id` for:
- Consistent author identification across email variations
- Grouping contributions by author
- Use `author_domain` to identify organization contributions

### Diff Statistics
Use `lines_added` and `lines_deleted` to:
- Calculate code churn
- Identify hotspots of activity
- Measure commit size and complexity

### Position Metrics
Use `sequence`, `is_first`, and `is_last` to:
- Identify file creation and final modifications
- Track commit order within file history
- Build timeline visualizations
